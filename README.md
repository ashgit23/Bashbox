Welcome to Bashbox! This repository is a collection of Bash scripts that I have created as part of my journey to learn and master Bash scripting. These scripts are primarily focused on ESXi administration tasks, but you may find them useful for other purposes as well.

Here, you'll find various scripts that automate and simplify tasks related to ESXi administration. Each script is documented with its purpose, usage, and any dependencies it may have.

Navigate through the folders to find the scripts you need. Each folder contains a README file with detailed information about the script.

I welcome contributions and feedback! Feel free to:

- Fork this repository and submit pull requests.

- Open issues for any bugs or feature requests.

- Suggest improvements and optimizations.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to me at pkdakshaym@gmail.com .

Let's learn and grow together!

Happy scripting!
