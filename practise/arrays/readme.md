# Arrays Practice: Backup Script

This project demonstrates how Bash arrays can simplify looping tasks.

## How it works
- Define an array of files: `files=("a" "b" "c")`
- Loop through the array and copy each file into a `backup/` directory
- Print a message for each file backed up

## Run
```bash
bash backup.sh
